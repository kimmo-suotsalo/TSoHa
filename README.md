# Dynamic Web Application

This is a simple dynamic web application that I designed and implemented in 2014 as a course project. The application provides a platform for conducting course surveys. There are three different user types: course administrator, teacher, and student. The data is stored in a relational database.

The technogies used in this project include HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL. The documentation is in Finnish.
